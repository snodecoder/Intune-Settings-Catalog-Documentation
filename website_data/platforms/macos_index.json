This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted because they were not properly publicly disclosed, continue to be used for enterprise hosts.\r\n\r\nIn order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled, you must set the hash to a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a legacy certificate authority (CA). A legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default by one or more operating systems supported by Microsoft Edge.\r\n\r\nYou specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the \"/\" character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is \"sha256\".\r\n\r\nIf you don't configure this policy, any certificate that's required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it isn't disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.\r\n\r\nThis policy is obsolete because the feature to disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for legacy certificates has been removed.\r\n\r\nExample value:\r\n\r\nsha256/AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA==\r\nsha256//////////////////////w==",

This lets enterprise administrators block file type extension-based download warnings for files that are associated with a listed domain. For example, if  the \"jnlp\" extension is associated with \"website1.com\", users would not see a warning when downloading \"jnlp\" files from \"website1.com\", but see a download warning when downloading \"jnlp\" files from \"website2.com\".\r\n\r\nFiles with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy will still be subject to non-file type extension-based security warnings such as mixed-content download warnings and Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings.\r\n\r\nIf you disable this policy or don't configure it, file types that trigger extension-based download warnings will show warnings to the user.\r\n\r\nIf you enable this policy:\r\n\r\n* The URL pattern should be formatted according to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322.\r\n* The file type extension entered must be in lower-cased ASCII. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type extension, so list \"jnlp\" should be used instead of \".jnlp\".\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nThe following example value would prevent file type extension-based download warnings on swf, exe, and jnlp extensions for *.contoso.com domains.

These origins won't be silently blocked from launching an external application by anti-flood protection. The trailing separator shouldn't be included when listing the protocol. For example, list \"skype\" instead of \"skype:\" or \"skype://\".\r\n\r\nIf you configure this policy, a protocol will only be permitted to bypass being silently blocked by anti-flood protection if:\r\n\r\n- the protocol is listed\r\n\r\n- the origin of the site trying to launch the protocol matches one of the origin patterns in that protocol's allowed_origins list.\r\n\r\nIf either condition is false, the external protocol launch may be blocked by anti-flood protection.\r\n\r\nIf you don't configure this policy, no protocols can bypass being silently blocked.\r\n\r\nThe origin matching patterns use a similar format to those for the 'URLBlocklist' (Block access to a list of URLs) policy, that are documented at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322.\r\n\r\nHowever, origin matching patterns for this policy cannot contain \"/path\" or \"@query\" elements.

This notification changes color once two thirds of the notification period passes, and again once the full notification period has passed. The additional notifications enabled by the \"RelaunchNotification\" policy follow this same schedule.\n\nIf not set, the default period of 604800000 milliseconds (one week) is used.",

Affected proxies are expected to fail connections with an error code of ERR_TLS13_DOWNGRADE_DETECTED.

Furthermore, permissions are granted for the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs.

When you take an extension off of the force-installed list it's automatically uninstalled by Microsoft Edge.\n\nFor Windows devices that aren't joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, forced installation is limited to extensions available in the Microsoft Store.\n\nNote that users can modify the source code of any extension by using Developer Tools, potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional. If this is a concern, set the \"DeveloperToolsAvailability\" policy.\n\nUse the following format to add an extension to the list:\n\n[extensionID];[updateURL]\n\n- extensionID - the 32-letter string found on edge://extensions when in developer mode.\n\n- updateURL (optional) is the address of the Update Manifest XML document for the app or extension, as described at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095043. If you don't set the updateURL, the Microsoft Store update URL is used (currently https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx).

For more information about hosting extensions, see: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095044.\n\nIf you don't configure this policy, no extensions are installed automatically, and users can uninstall any extension in Microsoft Edge.\n\nNote that this policy doesn't apply to InPrivate mode.",

The user must be signed into Microsoft Edge with a valid work or school account for reports to be sent, and the user's account tenant must match the tenant specified by the policy.\n\nIf you configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will send a report to the M365 Admin Center Site Lists app when a navigation appears stuck redirecting back and forth between the Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer engines several times. This usually indicates that redirection to an authentication server is switching engines, which repeatedly fails in a loop. The report will show the URL of the site that is the redirect target, minus any query string or fragment. The user's identity isn't reported.\n\nFor this reporting to work correctly, you must have successfully visited the Microsoft Edge Site Lists app in the M365 Admin Center at least once. This activates a per-tenant storage account used to store these reports. Microsoft Edge will still attempt to send reports if this step hasn't been completed. However, the reports will not be stored in the Site Lists app.\n\nWhen enabling this policy, you must specify your O365 tenant ID.

To avoid conflicting states, this policy is being deprecated and will be obsolete in milestone 85 onward. Please use the 'ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl' (Control communication with the Experimentation and Configuration Service) policy instead.\r\n\r\nIn Microsoft Edge, Domain Actions represent a series of compatibility features that help the browser work correctly on the web.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft keeps a list of actions to take on certain domains for compatibility reasons. For example, the browser may override the User Agent string on a website if that website is broken due to the new User Agent string on Microsoft Edge. Each of these actions is intended to be temporary while Microsoft tries to resolve the issue with the site owner.\r\n\r\nWhen the browser starts up and then periodically afterwards, the browser will contact the Experimentation and Configuration Service that contains the most up to date list of compatibility actions to perform. This list is saved locally after it is first retrieved so that subsequent requests will only update the list if the server's copy has changed.\r\n\r\nIf you enable this policy, the list of Domain Actions will continue to be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.\r\n\r\nIf you disable this policy, the list of Domain Actions will no longer be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.\r\n\r\nIf you don't configure this policy, the list of Domain Actions will continue to be downloaded from the Experimentation and Configuration Service.",

All permissions requested by the extensions are granted implicitly, without user interaction, including any additional permissions requested by future versions of the extension. Furthermore, permissions are granted for the enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension APIs. (These two APIs are only available to extensions that are force-installed.)\r\n\r\nThis policy takes precedence over a potentially conflicting 'ExtensionInstallBlocklist' (Control which extensions cannot be installed) policy. When you take an extension off of the force-installed list it's automatically uninstalled by Microsoft Edge.\r\n\r\nFor Windows devices that aren't joined to a Microsoft Active Directory domain, forced installation is limited to extensions available in the Microsoft Store.\r\n\r\nNote that users can modify the source code of any extension by using Developer Tools, potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional. If this is a concern, set the 'DeveloperToolsAvailability' (Control where developer tools can be used) policy.\r\n\r\nUse the following format to add an extension to the list:\r\n\r\n[extensionID];[updateURL]\r\n\r\n- extensionID - the 32-letter string found on edge://extensions when in developer mode.\r\n\r\n- updateURL (optional) is the address of the Update Manifest XML document for the app or extension, as described at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095043. If you don't set the updateURL, the Microsoft Store update URL is used (currently https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx).  Note that the update URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension use the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest.\r\n\r\nFor example, gggmmkjegpiggikcnhidnjjhmicpibll;https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx installs the Microsoft Online app from the Microsoft Store \"update\" URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095044.\r\n\r\nIf you don't configure this policy, no extensions are installed automatically, and users can uninstall any extension in Microsoft Edge.\r\n\r\nNote that this policy doesn't apply to InPrivate mode.\r\n\r\nExample value:\r\n\r\ngbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp;https://edge.microsoft.com/extensionwebstorebase/v1/crx\r\nabcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop",

This behavior can only be enabled if run_on_os_login is set to run_windowed.\r\nIf the app is already running, this setting will only take effect after the app is restarted.\r\nIf this field isn't defined, users can close the app.\r\n(This is currently not supported in Microsoft Edge.)\r\n- (Since version 118) The force_unregister_os_integration field specifies if all OS integration for a web app, that is, shortcuts, file handlers, protocol handlers and so on will be removed or not.\r\nIf an app is already running, this property will come into effect after the app restarts.\r\nThis should be used with caution, since it can override any OS integration that is set automatically during the startup of the web applications system.

The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.\n2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.\n3.

This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is \"sha256\".\n\nIf you disable this policy or don't configure it, any certificate that's required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it's not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.",

This lets enterprise administrators block file type extension-based download warnings for files that are associated with a listed domain.

The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type extension, so list \"jnlp\" should be used instead of \".jnlp\".\n\nExample:\n\nThe following example value would prevent file type extension-based download warnings on swf, exe, and jnlp extensions for *.contoso.com domains. It will show the user a file type extension-based download warning on any other domain for exe and jnlp files, but not for swf files.\n\n[\n  { \"file_extension\": \"jnlp\", \"domains\": [\"contoso.com\"] },\n  { \"file_extension\": \"exe\", \"domains\": [\"contoso.com\"] },\n  { \"file_extension\": \"swf\", \"domains\": [\"*\"] }\n]\n\nNote that while the preceding example shows the suppression of file type extension-based download warnings for \"swf\" files for all domains, applying suppression of such warnings for all domains for any dangerous file type extension is not recommended due to security concerns.

Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified. Otherwise, the policy will not be valid and will be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe USB permission model uses the URL of the requesting site (\"requesting URL\") and the URL of the top-level frame site (\"embedding URL\") to grant permission to the requesting URL to access the USB device. The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the \"urls\" field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status. The URLs in \"urls\" must be valid URLs, otherwise the policy will be ignored.\r\n\r\nIf this policy is left not set, the global default value will be used for all sites either from the 'DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting' (Control use of the WebUSB API) policy if it is set, or the user's personal configuration otherwise.\r\n\r\nURL patterns in this policy should not clash with the ones configured via 'WebUsbBlockedForUrls' (Block WebUSB on specific sites).

HTTPS clients must verify that server certificates match the\r\nconnection's TLS parameters.\r\n\r\nIf this policy is enabled,\r\nMicrosoft Edge will perform this key\r\ncheck. This helps prevent attacks where an attacker manipulates the browser into\r\ninterpreting a key in ways that the certificate owner did not intend.\r\n\r\nIf this policy is set to disabled or not configured,\r\nMicrosoft Edge will skip this key check in\r\nHTTPS connections that negotiate TLS 1.2 and use an RSA certificate that\r\nchains to a local trust anchor. Examples of local trust anchors include\r\npolicy-provided or user-installed root certificates. In all other cases, the\r\ncheck is performed independent of this policy's setting.\r\n\r\nThis policy is available for administrators to preview the behavior of a\r\nfuture release, which will enable this check by default.

Sites that fail with this error likely have a\r\nmisconfigured certificate. Modern ECDHE_RSA cipher suites use the\r\n\"digitalSignature\" key usage option, while legacy RSA decryption cipher suites\r\nuse the \"keyEncipherment\" key usage option. If uncertain, administrators should\r\ninclude both in RSA certificates meant for HTTPS.",

This lets enterprise administrators block file type extension-based download warnings for files that are associated with a listed domain. For example, if  the \"jnlp\" extension is associated with \"website1.com\", users would not see a warning when downloading \"jnlp\" files from \"website1.com\", but see a download warning when downloading \"jnlp\" files from \"website2.com\".\r\n\r\nFiles with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy will still be subject to non-file type extension-based security warnings such as mixed-content download warnings and Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings.\r\n\r\nIf you disable this policy or don't configure it, file types that trigger extension-based download warnings will show warnings to the user.\r\n\r\nIf you enable this policy:\r\n\r\n* The URL pattern should be formatted according to https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095322.\r\n* The file type extension entered must be in lower-cased ASCII. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type extension, so list \"jnlp\" should be used instead of \".jnlp\".\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nThe following example value would prevent file type extension-based download warnings on swf, exe, and jnlp extensions for *.contoso.com domains.

The user must be signed into Microsoft Edge with a valid work or school account for reports to be sent, and the user's account tenant must match the tenant specified by the policy.\r\n\r\nIf you configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will send a report to the M365 Admin Center Site Lists app when a navigation appears stuck redirecting back and forth between the Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer engines several times. This usually indicates that redirection to an authentication server is switching engines, which repeatedly fails in a loop. The report will show the URL of the site that is the redirect target, minus any query string or fragment. The user's identity isn't reported.\r\n\r\nFor this reporting to work correctly, you must have successfully visited the Microsoft Edge Site Lists app in the M365 Admin Center at least once. This activates a per-tenant storage account used to store these reports. Microsoft Edge will still attempt to send reports if this step hasn't been completed. However, the reports will not be stored in the Site Lists app.\r\n\r\nWhen enabling this policy, you must specify your O365 tenant ID. To learn more about finding your O365 tenant ID, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185668\r\n\r\nIf you disable or don't configure this policy, Microsoft Edge will never send reports about potentially misconfigured neutral sites to the Site Lists app.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Internet Explorer mode, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2165707\r\n\r\nExample value: aba95e58-070f-4784-8dcd-e5fd46c2c6d6",
